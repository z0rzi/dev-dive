# The Kata

You are provided with a `FormBuilder` class. This class has been written by someone who doesn't know anything about typescript types, and who clearly doesn't have time to lose with writing so-called "clean code".

Thankfully, you are here to save the day!

## Step 1
Your role will be to figure out what the code does, and remove **all** `any`, and **all** non-null assertion operators (`!` at the end of variables)

## Step 2
Change the code however you like so that the external user of the FormBuilder class doesn't have to infer the type when getting the form values:

```typescript
const myForm = new FormBuilder('form-container');

myForm.addField('date-of-birth', {
    type: 'date',
    label: 'Your date of Birth',
});

// Here, value should automatically be of the type `Date | null`, not `Date | number | string | null`
const value = myForm.getFieldValue('date-of-birth');
```

## Step 3
When using `setFieldValue()`, the function should only accept the proper type as the second argument:

```typescript
const myForm = new FormBuilder('form-container');

myForm.addField('date-of-birth', {
    type: 'date',
    label: 'Your date of Birth',
});

myForm.setFieldValue('date-of-birth', '1997')
//                                    ^
//                                    Error - A Date was expected, but a string was received.
```

# About the code

Although you shouldn't need it, you can run the code using:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## Reminders

```typescript
class MyClass {
    constructor (private property: number) {}
}

// Is the same as

class MyClass {
    private property: number;

    constructor(prop: number) {
        this.property = prop;
    }
}
```

Here are a few type examples, to refresh your memories:
```typescript
// Basic types
const var: Date | number | string | null;

const array: (typeof var)[];

const bool: boolean;

const obj: {[key: string]: Date};
// Same as
const obj2: Record<string, Date>;

const func: (num1: number, num2: number) => number;

// Type alias
type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    residence: {
        address: string;
        city: string;
        country: string;
    }
}

function getPersonResidence(person: Person): Person['residence'] {
    return person.residence
}

// Generics
type FetchResponse<TData> {
    success: boolean;
    data: TData;
    timestamp: Date;
}

async function fetchData<TData extends number | string = number | string>(address: string): Promise<FetchResponse<TData>> {
    return fetch(address, options);
}

fetchData<Date>('/api/get-data')
// |
// '-> Will cause an error because Date is not 'number' | 'string'

const res = await fetchData<number>('/api/get-data');
const data = res.data;
// |
// '-> data will be of the type `number`

const res = await fetchData('/api/get-data');
const data = res.data;
// |
// '-> data will be of the type `number | string`


```

Happy coding!
