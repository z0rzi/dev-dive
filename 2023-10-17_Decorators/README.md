# Higher order functions and the decorator Pattern in JavaScript

This week, we're going to talk about Higher order functions and the decorator Pattern!

Higher-order functions are your programming Swiss Army knives. They can take in, manipulate, and return functions, making your code more adaptable and expressive. The decorator pattern uses this concept to enhance objects' functionality without altering their core structure.

Together, these concepts empower you to create versatile and modular code. These are great tools for code modularity and flexibility.
