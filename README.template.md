And this is the one I use for generating the katas:

---

I organize a bi-weekly meeting called DevDive, where we practice a technical topic as a group.
For our upcoming event, the focus is on [[Main Topic]]. I'm in need of a coding kata specifically tailored for this session.

Write a kata which can be cnallenging for both beginners and experienced developers. The challenge should be approachable and stimulating for all experience levels.
It should take around an hour to complete the kata.

The kata should be divided in different challenges, each one building on the previous one, and increasing in difficulty.
The challenges should cover different aspects of the topic.

Write the kata as it should be given to the students.
Write your answer in Markdown format.
Give code examples and explanations where necessary.
