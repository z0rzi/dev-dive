This is the ChatGPT prompt I use to generate the first draft for the event descriptions:

---

I organize a bi-weekly meeting called DevDive, where we learn about a tech topic as a group.
The next event is about `My Topic`. Help me to write a description, following this template:

# [[Main Topic]]

This week, we're going to talk about [[Main Topic]]!

[[A few sentences to explain how the topic is important to know as a developper, what are the situations where the topic is especially useful]]

[[One sentence to motivate the reader to join the event (e.g. Join us for an exciting exploration about... , Come to discover how ...)]]

And this is the one I use for generating the katas:

---

I organize a bi-weekly meeting called DevDive, where we learn about a tech topic as a group.
For our upcoming event, the focus is on [[Main Topic]]. I'm in need of a coding kata specifically tailored for this session.

The ideal kata should strike a balance: it should present a level of complexity that keeps both junior and seasoned programmers engaged for about an hour. The goal is to offer a challenge that's approachable and stimulating for all experience levels. Looking forward to your creative and insightful suggestions

Write the kata as it should be given to the students.
