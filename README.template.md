This is the ChatGPT prompt I use to generate the first draft for the event descriptions:

---

I organize a bi-weekly meeting called DevDive, where we learn about a tech topic as a group.
The next event is about `My Topic`. Help me to write a description, following this template:

# [[Main Topic]]

This week, we're going to talk about [[Main Topic]]!

[[A few sentences to explain how the topic is important to know as a developper, what are the situations where the topic is especially useful]]

[[One sentence to motivate the reader to join the event (e.g. Join us for an exciting exploration about... , Come to discover how ...)]]
