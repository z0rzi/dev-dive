## DevDive

What is DevDive? It's a bi-weekly event (once every 2 weeks), where we will dive in a coding concept.

Each session will be divided in 3 parts:
1. Before the session, at home
  Get familiar with the topic, read about it, watch videos, experiment
2. First part of the session (1h)
 Coding kata around the topic
3. Second part of the session (1h)
 Presentation of the different kata solutions, discussion about the topic


Disclaimers:
- This is a study group, not a class or a course. 
- Some topics might be too advanced for absolute beginners. Although all levels are welcome, make sure to acquire a basic understanding of the topic before coming.
