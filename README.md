## DevDive

What is DevDive? It's a bi-weekly event (once every 2 weeks), where we will dive in a coding concept.

Each session will be divided in 3 parts:
1. Before the session, at home
  Get familiar with the topic, read about it, watch videos, experiment
2. First part of the session (1h)
 Coding kata around the topic
3. Second part of the session (1h)
 Presentation of the different kata solutions, discussion about the topic


Disclaimers:
- This is a study group, not a class or a course. 
- Some topics might be too advanced for absolute beginners. Although all levels are welcome, make sure to acquire a basic understanding of the topic before coming.

### Ideas for future events:

Sum of big big big numbers

Encription of a list of numbers.

Code compiler

Self generating code

Given a string, give all the possible passwords created with this string (with every char used once)

Roman number calculator

Find hamming number
A Hamming number is a positive integer of the form 2i3j5k, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.
Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.

Specifically:
The first  smallest Hamming number is 1 = 2^0 * 3^0 * 5^0
The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 2^1 * 3^0 * 5^0
The third  smallest Hamming number is 3 = 2^0 * 3^1 * 5^0
The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0
The fifth  smallest Hamming number is 5 = 2^0 * 3^0 * 5^1
...

Your code should be able to compute the first 5 000 Hamming numbers without timing out.
